# Pivestream
A ridiculously simple livestream system for any Raspberry Pi with a Pi Cam.

This is about as simple as it gets.  Run the install file on your Raspberry Pi and your Raspberry Pi will start an mjpg-based livestream any time it boots.  Access this livestream by going to `http://<IPv4_of_your_pi>:7000` in the web browser of any device connected to the same network (or set up port forwarding and use your public IP address to access from any network).

_Note, however, that this livestream is **not encrypted in any way**, and that it can be easily accessed by anyone connected to your network.  This camera system is useful for simple tasks, like monitoring 3D-prints or wildlife, but is likely not suitable for home-monitoring systems or other settings that ought to require privacy.  Please keep this in mind when using this software._

## NOTE: THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.  PLEASE CHECK BACK HERE TOMORROW FOR THE FINISHED CODE.
